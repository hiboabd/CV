## Profile

I am a go-getter with a curious mind, who likes to experiment with different perspectives and new challenges. I become a developer due to the unique combination of personal satisfaction, self development and creative expression it can fulfil.Â 
 
After graduating from University College London with a first class degree in Psychology, I spent almost two years working as a Market Researcher for a youth research agency.

I have recently completed training at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech) (London's leading programming bootcamp), to make my dream of becoming a developer a reality.

I wish to work for a mission-led and value driven company who are committed to bringing positive change. I hope to contribute to big projects as part of a fun, supportive team where I can learn from people of all walks of life.

## Personal aim 

I am committed to using my technical skills to increase accessibility and inclusivity in tech, particularly among BAME and Muslims. I blog about my tech journey (Twitter: @hibocodes, Dev.to: @hiboabd) and I mentor others to take their first steps towards a career in tech.

I hope to get the support from the company I work for in doing this as its incredibly close to my heart.

## Non-technical skills

I have developed transferable skills that are vital to success in a role as a Software Developer. In addition to the technical programming skills gained at Makers Academy, I believe this gives me a unique set of soft and hard skills that can add value to any organisation. This includes:

#### Project management

<details><summary>Click to read</summary>
<p>
As a research executive at YouthSight, I was entrusted to manage a number of projects including:
<ul>
    <li> A longitudinal research tracker that tracked the views of Generation Z on a range of topics. </li>
    <li> A campaign evaluation looking into perceptions of a new brand re-design. </li>
    <li> I created a scheduling document for all projects in our team which improved our ability to track the status of active projects and potential prospects as      well as delegate responsibilities amongst team members. </li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>

#### Organisation and attention to detail

<details><summary>Click to read</summary>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> During my time at YouthSight, I created numerous training documents concerning research processes, data analysis, and more to ensure best practises were recorded and there was a central reference point for all employees. </li>
    <li> As my GitHub projects will demonstrate, I am a meticulous planner who diagrams and designs her project to make sure the </li>
    <li> Example: <a href="https://github.com/hiboabd/BankTechTest">Bank Tech Test</a></li>
    <li> My methodical approach to programming has also been noted in technical reviews: </li>
        <li> <i><q>You were familiar with the common errors caused by failing tests. You checked if you saved your file, read the error message, checked for         typos, tried changing the order of the if-statements and had a look at the new output. You used the IRB to verify the behaviour of functions such as the split function. You used prints to get some visibility in your code. This was all nicely methodical and a good debugging process.</q></i></li> 
</ul>
</p>
</details>

#### Presenting and communicating

<details><summary>Click to read</summary>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> I pride myself on being a clear communicator. Below is some feedback I've received on my communication skills following a technical review.</li>
    <li> <i><q>Your verbalisation really underscores your understanding and reasoning really well</q></i> </li>
    <li> <i><q>You walked me through the logic of your program before running it in RSpec and gave me insights into the different ways of
        approaching the program that you were considering</q></i> </li>
    <li> I designed ebooks that contributed to the growth of conversions on the YouthSight eNewsletter. The <a href="https://www.youthsight.com/blog/how-gen-z-will-change-the-world-vol-one">How Gen Z will change the world</a> ebook series I designed was so popular that it led to a webinar with approximately 100 attendees. </li>
    <li> I also delivered pitches to the BBC and NCS, where both projects were subsequently commissioned. In the case of NCS, the project was repeat commissioned for 3 years.</li> 
</ul>
</p>
</details>

#### Teamwork and interpersonal skills

<details><summary>Click to read</summary>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> I thoroughly enjoy working with others and pair programming was a significant component of the Makers Academy program where I paired with a colleague on a challenge every afternoon. </li>
    <li> I am careful to curate a positive team atmosphere by being an effective communicator and listener, setting and achieving clear goals, being open minded to others ideas, being attentive and supporting my team members as much as possible. </li>
    <li> I documented my personal do's and dont's of pair programming <a href="https://github.com/hiboabd/makers_learning_journey/blob/master/weekly-objectives/week-one/pair_programming.md">here.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
</details>
